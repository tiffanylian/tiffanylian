## 💡 Projects
1. **Edge Explorer (Java Swing)**
   - Collaborated in a team of 3 to build an interactive GUI (Java Swing) for building graphs and visualizing BFS, DFS, Topological Sorting, and Dijkstra's algorithms. Aimed at educating pre-college students on algorithmic steps.

2. **Academy Awards Web Crawler (Java, JSoup, Regex)**
   - Web crawler application allowing users to query information from Wikipedia's live Academy Awards page using Java, JSoup, and pattern matching with Regex.

3. **Google Intern Project (Java)**
   - Developed a new Producer Graph in Java, manipulating and scheduling async tasks to downsize media and recover user storage quota during a Google internship. Contributed to decreasing technical debt and preserving Single Responsibility Principle.

4. **Instagram-Lite and Chrome Extension (Upcoming)**
   - Exciting projects in progress! Stay tuned for more details on Instagram-Lite and a Chrome extension.
